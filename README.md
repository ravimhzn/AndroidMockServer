# AndroidMockServer (Work in progres....)
Mock Server built using JetpackComposeUI. The project will run a local server in Android OS to emulate the behaviour of actual back-end server. 
The idea behind the project is to eliminate the need to wait for APIs to be ready by BE while we already have solution design ready.
